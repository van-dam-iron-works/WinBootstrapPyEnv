WinBootstrapPyEnv
=================

WinBootstrapPyEnv is a collection of scripts and binaries that can be used to 
install a reasonable Python environment into Windows. The scripts should work 
for Windows XP 32bit and 64bit, Windows Vista 32bit and 64bit, and Windows7 
32bit and 64bit. It is untested on WinXP 64bit, Vista 32bit and 64bit, 
Windows7 32bit, and all versions of Windows8. Python2.7, Python3.2, and 
Python3.3 are supported.

The script uses curl to download a Python installer, a PyWin32 installer, and 
setuptool's bootstrap script (ez_install). Python and PyWin32 are installed, 
followed by running the setuptools bootstrap script. easy_install is then used 
to install pip, and finally, pip is used to install virtualenv.

Instructions:
    1. Download this project as a zip file from GitHub.
    2. Unzip the zip file.
    3. Open a console (cmd.exe) with Administrator rights.
    4. Run the bootstrap.bat file for the Python version and CPU architecture
       you need.
    5. Run the installer GUIs as they appear.

Notes:
    * If you do not run cmd as Administrator, you will have to verify admin 
      rights for the Python and PyWin32 installers. You will also have to 
      manually clean up the PyWin32 installer.
