WinBootstrapPyEnv
=================

WinBootstrapPyEnv is a collection of scripts and binaries that can be used to 
install a reasonable Python environment into WindowsXP or Windows7. It 
currently requires you to manually install Python2.7 or Python3.2 before the 
rest of the script will work.

The script will use wget to download distribute's bootstrap script, which is 
then used to install distribute. It will then use easy_install to install pip.
Finally, it will use pip to install virtualenv. At that point you should be 
all set!
